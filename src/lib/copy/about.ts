  text: "Hello friendly friend and welcome to my portfolio website. As you might have guessed, my name is Djimo van Berlo. I have a background in psychology and creating and leading real-life games. In 2020 I retrained as full-stack developer and haven't looked back since. I love to learn and discover new things and explore new ideas. I take an investigative approach towards many themes, like history, society, philosophy and of course programming. In my free time I like to play with some code, cook up some games and develop some dinner. I like to walk around and explore my surroundings, and perhaps the occasional draping-over-the-couch. I'm married and I've lived in three countries (so far) and speak three languages (Dutch, English, Norwegian (bokmål)) - with some French and German sprinkled in. Have a look around! Or not, it's 100% up to you. Truly.",

I consider myself creative and analytical, and I like to think I'm a good communicator. I have experience with many different types of projects, both professionally and personally - from a large HR vacancies site to an app for a smart boxing bag or blogs built with a headless CMS. I love writing clean, reusable code and I'm always looking to improve my skills. Below you can see a bunch of technologies I have experience with.",
